## An Introduction to Linux, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core & Docker (Workshop)

Welcome to _An Introduction to Linux, .NET Core, ASP.NET Core & Docker_, a full-day workshop.

In this workshop you will learn about: [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org), [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com), [.NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core), [ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core), [Docker](https://www.docker.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) and more.

By the end of this workshop you will be ready to use Linux and .NET Core on your next work or personal project!

### Software Versions

As this workshop is conducted solely in a virtual machine you should be able to complete it in _any_ host operating system supporting the latest version of [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org).

I have tested the workshop with the following software versions. You mileage may vary if you choose to use software and/or versions other than those listed below.

| Software | Version |
| -------- | ------- |
| [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org) | 5.0.26 |
| [Ubuntu Linux](http://www.ubuntu.com) | 16.04.1 x64 LTS |
| [.NET Core SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) | 1.0.0-preview2-003131 |
| [ASP.NET Core](http://www.asp.net/core) | 1.0.0 |
| [Docker](https://www.docker.com) | 1.12.1 |
| [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) | ? |
| [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) | ? |

## The Workshop

__The workshop begins here.__ You have approximately 45 minutes to complete each chapter. If you complete a chapter ahead of time _please_ don't jump ahead. You should instead just explore what you have built and/or complete the extension exercise at the bottom of the chapter.

#### 1. Ubuntu Linux Installation

If you don't have a __fresh__ Ubuntu Linux installation then start at __[Part 1](Part1.md)__.

#### 2. Ubuntu Linux Configuration & Maintenance

Now you have a __fresh__ Ubuntu Linux installation go to __[Part 2](Part2.md)__.

#### 3. "Hello, world!" .NET Core

Once you have __configured__ Ubuntu Linux head over to __[Part 3](Part3.md)__.

#### 4. "Hello, world!" ASP.NET Core

So you have said your _first hello_ to .NET Core? Continue on with __[Part 4](Part4.md)__.

#### 5. "Hello, world!" Docker

And a _second hello_ to ASP.NET Core? Strap on your helmet for __[Part 5](Part5.md)__.

#### 6. "Hello, world!" via Node.js & Yeoman

Once you made your _third hello_ to Docker embark on __[Part 6](Part6.md)__.

#### 7. Composing Applications with Containers (Draft)

Now we have .NET Core, ASP.NET Core and Docker running we know all the basics but how do actually we actually build applications? __[Part 7](Part7.md)__ will elaborate on linking, networking and composing applications.

## Workshop Complete

Congratulations! You have completed the workshop.

#### Next "choose your own adventure"...

Here are some ideas for what you might like to work on next.

1. Use the [Ubuntu Apps Directory](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/) to "re-build" your desktop (with all the apps you love) in Ubuntu.

2. Continue building-out and adding-to your [Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) application.

3. Ignore Docker completely and build a [Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228) on .NET Core.

4. Have an existing .NET application? [Here's a guide on porting it to .NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/10/porting-to-net-core/).

5. Know a good FOSS .NET framework or library that isn't yet available on .NET Core? Mark Rendle says [port it to .NET Core](https://blog.rendle.io/net-core-a-call-to-action/). Go go go!

Or just do whatever takes your fancy, but remember...

__*Production or it didn't happen!*__
