#### 1. Ubuntu Linux Installation

If you don't have a __fresh__ Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x64 installation then start at __[Part 1](Part1.md)__.

#### 2. Ubuntu Linux Configuration & Maintenance

Now you have a __fresh__ Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x64 installation go to __[Part 2](Part2.md)__.

#### 3. "Hello, world!" .NET Core

Once you have __configured__ Ubuntu 16.04 (LTS) x64 head over to __[Part 3](Part3.md)__.

#### 4. "Hello, world!" ASP.NET Core

So you have said your _first hello_ to .NET Core? Continue on with __[Part 4](Part4.md)__.

#### 5. "Hello, world!" Docker

_(Work In Progress)_  And a _second hello_ to ASP.NET Core? Strap on your helmet for __[Part 5](Part5.md)__.

#### 6a. "Hello, world!" via Node.js & Yeoman

_(Work In Progress)_ Once you made your _third hello_ to Docker you might choose to embark on __[Part 6a](Part6a.md)__.

#### 6b. Composing applications with containers

_(Work In Progress)_ Now we have some Docker running. We know all the basics but how do actually we actually build applications? __[Part 6B](Part6b.md)__ will elaborate on linking, networking and composing. 


#### Congratulations and your further journey
_(Work In Progress)_ Ideas for where to go next, jump to __[Part the end](Congratulations.md)
