# Congratulations!

You have completed the workshop.

## Next => Choose your own adventure...
Bring your application from parts 3 and 4 over to Docker. The idea is that you will [compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) your .NET Core and ASP.NET Core applications from separate Docker containers into an integrated application-whole and get them communicating to each other over the [network](https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/networking/) i.e. this is the beginning of your journey into [Docker-hosted Microservices](https://dotnet.github.io/docs/tutorials/getting-started-with-csharp/microservices.html).

1. Use the [Ubuntu Apps Directory](https://apps.ubuntu.com/cat/) to "re-build" your desktop (with all the apps you love) in Ubuntu.

2. Continuing building-out and adding-to your [Microservices](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html) application.

3. Ignore Docker completely and build a [Majestic Monolith](https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith-29166d022228) on .NET Core.

4. Have an existing .NET application? [Here's a guide on porting to .NET Core](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/dotnet/2016/02/10/porting-to-net-core/).

5. Know a good FOSS .NET framework or library that isn't yet available on .NET Core? Mark Rendle says [port it to .NET Core](https://blog.rendle.io/net-core-a-call-to-action/). Go go go!

6. Looking for something new? Interested in JavaScript? Try out my "work in progress" __Part 6__ [.NET Core "Hello, world!" via Node.js & Yeoman](Part6.md).

Or just do whatever takes your fancy, but remember...

__Production or it didn't happen!__

I encourage you to share what you have built under an [OSI-approved license](https://opensource.org/licenses) on [GitHub](https://github.com/).
